An FPS Booster/Unlocker For Stumble Guys

The Software will first check if stumble guys is already running. If it is, it will close it before applying the changes.
It applies the fps boost with "qualitysettings-frameRate=Unlimited" which applies to almost all unity games including Stumble Guys.
After Applying the changes and restarting the game, it will record the fps with pygetwindow and imagegrab. The recording of fps is not always accurate but it is never far off.

The normal fps cap for Stumble Guys witohut Vsync is 480fps but ive seen it go up to 800 with my Unlocker.

Have Fun and dont steal my work!

An FPS Booster/Unlocker For Stumble Guys

The Software will first check if stumble guys is already running. If it is, it will close it before applying the changes.
It applies the fps boost with "qualitysettings-frameRate=Unlimited" which applies to almost all unity games including Stumble Guys.
I also set the game cpu priority to high or even real-time depending or your computer.
After Applying the changes and restarting the game, it will record the fps with pygetwindow and imagegrab. The recording of fps is not always accurate but it is never far off.

The normal fps cap for Stumble Guys without Vsync is 480fps but ive seen it go up to 800 with my Unlocker.

This is opensource as you can easily decompile my exe. and this is intentional for you to see there really isnt anything going on behind the scenes!
I did not engage with any type of python encryption I just compiled it raw with pyinstaller.

Since I left it like that  would really appreciate it if you didn't steal my work. Thanks!
